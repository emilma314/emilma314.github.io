# Gravitational Waves and Strain

This project explores **gravitational-wave strain** using real LIGO
time-series data. Because detector noise dominates the raw signal,
we apply signal-processing techniques to reveal astrophysical events.

## Core Equation

A passing gravitational wave produces a fractional change in length:

\[
h(t) = \frac{\Delta L(t)}{L}
\]

Typical observed strains are on the order of \(10^{-21}\).
