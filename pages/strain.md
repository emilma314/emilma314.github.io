title: What Is Strain?
---

## Definition

In gravitational-wave physics, **strain** is defined as:

\[
h(t) = \frac{\Delta L(t)}{L}
\]

where:
- \(L\) is the interferometer arm length
- \(\Delta L(t)\) is the differential length change caused by the wave

## Physical Interpretation

Gravitational waves stretch space in one direction while compressing it
in the perpendicular direction. LIGO measures this effect using laser
interferometry over 4 km arms.

The resulting displacements are smaller than a proton diameter.
