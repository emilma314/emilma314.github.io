## Source

The data used in this project comes from the **LIGO Open Science Center (LOSC)**.

## Format

LIGO strain data is provided as a time series:

- Sampling rate: typically 4096 or 16384 Hz
- Units: dimensionless strain
- Dominated by detector noise

In the next sections, we visualize this raw data and transform it to
understand the noise structure.
