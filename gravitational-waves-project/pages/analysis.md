## Raw Time Series

The raw strain time series appears noise-dominated, making astrophysical
signals difficult to identify by eye.

## Transformations

To reveal structure, we apply:
- Fourier transforms
- Power spectral density estimation
- (Later) whitening and filtering

Plots from these steps are shown below.
